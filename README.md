Toyota 4WD IFS Frame Brace

Lower Control Arm Frame Brace for Toyota IFS 4WD Pickup, Hilux, 4Runner and Hilux Surf models

Application: 1986 -1995 US models, later years for international models.

Frame braces mount between the lower control arms on 1st and 2nd generation Toyota 4X4's with IFS. These braces prevent the mounts from spreading apart under heavy impact while serving as a convenient surface for skit plate mounting. These are made from .25" steel all around and are very strong. The frame brace comes with all necessary hardware.

Typical distance between the vehicle LCA mounts is 17" but this can vary up to 1/2" either way, so be sure to measure the separation of the rear lower control arm brackets.  Adjust the dimensions of the 2-1/2" square tubing length as needed.

Likewise, the width of the lower control arm bracket seems to be either 2-1/2" or 3" wide, so adjust the dimensions of the pair of end brackets as needed.  For the 2-1/2" width, use 3" x 0.250 wall square turning.  For the 3" width, use 3-1/2" x 0.250 wall square tubing.

You can use a hole saw, plasma or oxy-fuel torch or a grinder and cutoff wheel to make the recess in the top of the cross bar below where the front driveshaft runs.

You could use round tube or flat stock if you cut a trapezoidal notch.

For welding, one option is to install the end brackets on your truck with 4 - M8x100 or 5/16x4" bolts.  Then tack weld the cross tube in place, then lower the brace and weld it out.
